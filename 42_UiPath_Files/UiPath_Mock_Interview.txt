7.Exception Handling & Scenarios Questions?
-> Exception handling deals with handling errors while execution of activities.
Can be handled using:
  - Try Catch,
  - Throw  - Explicitly throw an exception, maily used for business rule exceptionbut it can throw any exception.,User can throw his own exception in detail.
  - ReThrow - This will rethrow the exception which is already occured. Rethrow from child to parent. - Parent can handle all type of Exception.
  - Terminate Workflow
  - Contine on Error - make it true to run the automation if the error occured on one flow.If we have multiple step in a container we can set the true value in container level.
  - Using Global Exception Handler - 
      * Only One GH can have in the workflow,

	  2 predefined arguments
	    1)errorInfo
