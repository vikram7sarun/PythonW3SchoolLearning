UiPath_RE_Framework: - Developed using State Machine

**************************************
1. State              |   Invoke Workflow                             
------------------------------------------------------------
Initialization        |   InitAllSetting.xaml   - Config file load. (Sheet - Constatnt,Setting and Assert)
						  KillAllProcess.xaml   - 
                          InitAllApplications.xaml

    System Exception  |  Success

Get Transaction Data  |   GetTransactionData.xaml

    No Data           |   Transaction data


Process Transaction   |   Process.xaml
                          SetTransactionStatus.xaml
                            * RetryCurrentTransaction.xaml
                            * TakeScreenshot.xaml
                            * CloseAllApplication
                            * KillAllApplication

    Success   | System Exception  | Business Exception

End Process           |   CloseAllApplication
                          KillAllApplication							

----------------------------------------------------------
2.Advantage:

1. Don't wanna create New Framework we can use this and create effective framework.
2. Perform transaction Oriented Automation Process.
3. Best Exception handling.
4. Logging and Testing machanism is handled properly.
5. Very simple and easy to use.
6. Config and setting files are already defined.
7. If we use orchestrator more better to retrive transaction.
8. Reduce time.  
--------------------------------
3. Global variables - 11

1. Transaction Item , 2. System Exception. 3.Business Exception 4. Transaction Number 5.Config
6. Retry Number 7. Transaction Field2 8. Transaction Field1 9. Transaction ID 10.dt_TransactionData
11.Consecutive System Exception.
------------------------------------
4. Which part Run only once in RE framework?   --> First Run Workflow - Coz config will have something next time.
-------------------------------------
5.Closing application Fails:
Throw Exception - > log is printed -> kill the process
-----------------------------------------
6.Stop live running RE framework:
 Orch -> Stop or Killed
Studio -> get transaction Data -> check stop signal - true -> log -> end process
---------------------------------------- 
Things To do if we get the transaction data without using Orchestrator Queue

1.Add Read Range Activity after init all application -> Op TransactionData
2.Remove Should Stop Activity.
3.Change TransactionItem = DataRow
4.if dt_TransactionData.Rows.Count < TransactionNumber
        Get TransactData		
----------------------------------------
Projects:
Different Process:

1.PI -> StocksHolding -> Trade information(Daily Data, Weekly data) ->  Excel -> Dispacher -> Performer -> Used for different Purpose
2.PI Next Gen -> Goals(Account/Expense/) -> Retirement , Education Goal , Savings Goal.
3.Customer Interaction -> Email Automation
4.Trade Statement(Options,Stocks) -> Pdf Automation (Document Understanding)
5.Pi Rembursement ->  Document Understnding and Action Center.

StocksHolding Trade Retention
