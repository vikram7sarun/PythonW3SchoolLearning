# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

class Student(Person):
  pass

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

# The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

# Use the super() Function
# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
