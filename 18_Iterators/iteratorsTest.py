# Python Iterators
# An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
# An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
# Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().

# Iterator vs Iterable
# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))


mystr = "banana"
myit = iter(mystr)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
